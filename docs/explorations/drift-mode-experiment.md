# Drift Mode Experiment - Digital Buddha Board

## Overview
This document captures the learnings from our experiment to create a "Drift" mode - a digital Buddha board experience where ink is impermanent and fades away, emphasizing mindfulness and the transient nature of creation.

## Core Concept
- **Impermanence**: Brush strokes live for exactly 1 minute before gradually fading
- **Meditative Experience**: No tools, no image uploads - just pure drawing
- **Ghost Memory**: Faded strokes leave subtle 5-10% opacity traces
- **Individual Stroke Fading**: Each stroke fades independently based on its creation time

## Successful Components (Worth Keeping)

### 1. Toast Message System ✨
**Location**: `sketch.js` - `showDriftToast()` function

**What We Built**:
- Poetic, philosophical messages that slide down from the top
- Random selection from a curated list of mindfulness quotes
- Smooth CSS animations with fade-in/fade-out effects

**Sample Messages**:
- "Like morning mist, your thoughts will fade..."
- "Each stroke is a breath, each breath a moment..."
- "In the space between creation and dissolution lies peace..."

**Why It Works**:
- Sets the meditative tone immediately
- Provides context for the impermanent nature of the mode
- Beautiful, non-intrusive user experience

### 2. Audio System 🎵
**Location**: `sketch.js` - `initAudio()`, `startBreathingEffect()`, `playDrawingSound()`

**What We Built**:
- Web Audio API integration with gain nodes
- Ambient oscillator for background atmosphere
- Breathing-synchronized audio that pulses with canvas opacity
- Subtle drawing sounds (sine wave) for each stroke
- Audio context management with proper cleanup

**Technical Implementation**:
```javascript
// Ambient sound that syncs with breathing effect
this.ambientGain = audioContext.createGain();
this.breathingGain = audioContext.createGain();

// Drawing sound - subtle sine wave
const oscillator = audioContext.createOscillator();
oscillator.frequency.setValueAtTime(220, audioContext.currentTime);
```

**Why It Works**:
- Enhances the meditative experience
- Provides subtle feedback for user actions
- Creates a cohesive audio-visual experience

### 3. Breathing Effect 🌬️
**Location**: `sketch.js` - `startBreathingEffect()`, `stopBreathingEffect()`

**What We Built**:
- Subtle opacity changes on the canvas background
- Smooth transitions using CSS transitions
- Synchronized with audio breathing
- Creates a living, breathing canvas

**Technical Implementation**:
```javascript
// Breathing effect - subtle opacity pulsing
const breathingPhase = (Date.now() / 3000) % (Math.PI * 2);
const breathingOpacity = 0.95 + 0.05 * Math.sin(breathingPhase);
canvasWrap.style.opacity = breathingOpacity;
```

**Why It Works**:
- Adds life to the static canvas
- Reinforces the meditative, breathing-focused experience
- Subtle enough not to be distracting

### 4. UI State Management 🎛️
**Location**: `sketch.js` - `enterDriftMode()`, `exitDriftMode()`

**What We Built**:
- Clean toolbar hiding/showing
- Mode-specific state management
- Proper cleanup when switching modes
- Toast message integration

**Why It Works**:
- Clean, distraction-free drawing experience
- Clear mode boundaries
- Proper resource management

## Technical Challenges & Learnings

### 1. Individual Stroke Fading
**Challenge**: Making each stroke fade independently while maintaining real-time drawing

**What We Tried**:
- Tracking individual strokes with timestamps
- Redrawing canvas with individual opacities
- Pausing fade timer during drawing

**Key Learning**: The watercolor brush system is complex and doesn't easily support individual stroke tracking without major refactoring.

### 2. Real-time Drawing vs Fade Timer
**Challenge**: Fade timer was interfering with real-time drawing experience

**What We Tried**:
- Pausing fade timer while drawing (`pauseWhileDrawing()`)
- Resuming after stroke completion (`resumeAfterDrawing()`)
- Conditional canvas redrawing

**Key Learning**: The watercolor brush has its own drawing pipeline that conflicts with external fade management.

### 3. Brush Size Consistency
**Challenge**: Brush size was inconsistent in drift mode

**What We Tried**:
- Setting brush size in `startDraw()` and `drawTo()`
- Ensuring proper size updates during drawing

**Key Learning**: The watercolor brush needs explicit size updates at multiple points in the drawing process.

## Code Architecture Insights

### Fade Timer System
**File**: `fade-timer.js`

**Key Methods**:
- `addStroke(strokeData)` - Track individual strokes
- `getStrokeOpacity(stroke)` - Calculate individual fade opacity
- `pauseWhileDrawing()` / `resumeAfterDrawing()` - Drawing state management
- `applyFade()` - Redraw canvas with individual stroke opacities

**Architecture Pattern**: The fade timer acts as a central coordinator, but conflicts with the watercolor brush's internal state management.

### Watercolor Brush Integration
**File**: `watercolor-brush.js`

**Key Methods**:
- `getCurrentStrokePoints()` - Extract stroke data for tracking
- `getFadeOpacity()` - Return 1.0 in drift mode
- `setSize(size)` - Update brush size

**Architecture Pattern**: The watercolor brush is designed for immediate rendering, not for external stroke tracking.

## Recommendations for Future Implementation

### 1. Hybrid Approach
Instead of trying to track individual strokes in the existing watercolor brush system, consider:
- A simpler stroke tracking system for drift mode
- Separate rendering pipeline for fade effects
- Layer-based approach with individual stroke layers

### 2. Preserve These Components
The following components work beautifully and should be preserved:
- Toast message system
- Audio/breathing effects
- UI state management
- Mode switching logic

### 3. Simplified Fade System
For the fade effect, consider:
- Canvas-level fade with `globalAlpha`
- Simpler stroke tracking without individual opacity
- Time-based fade that affects the entire canvas

## Files Modified in Experiment

1. **`index.html`** - Added "Drift" option to dropdown
2. **`fade-timer.js`** - Individual stroke tracking system
3. **`sketch.js`** - Drift mode logic, audio, breathing, toast messages
4. **`watercolor-brush.js`** - Stroke point tracking, fade opacity handling
5. **`style.css`** - Toast animations, breathing effects
6. **`prompts.js`** - Drift-specific prompts

## Git History
- **Staging Branch**: Contains all experiment code
- **Stash**: "Drift mode experiment - individual stroke fading, toast messages, audio, breathing effect"
- **Main Branch**: Reverted to clean state

## Next Steps
1. Extract the successful components (toast, audio, breathing) into reusable modules
2. Design a simpler fade system that works with the existing watercolor brush
3. Consider a different approach to individual stroke fading
4. Test the preserved components in isolation

## Key Code Snippets

### Toast Message System
```javascript
function showDriftToast() {
  const messages = [
    "Like morning mist, your thoughts will fade...",
    "Each stroke is a breath, each breath a moment...",
    "In the space between creation and dissolution lies peace...",
    "The canvas breathes with your intention...",
    "Impermanence is the only constant..."
  ];
  
  const message = messages[Math.floor(Math.random() * messages.length)];
  // Toast implementation with CSS animations
}
```

### Audio System
```javascript
function initAudio() {
  this.audioContext = new (window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext)();
  this.breathingGain = this.audioContext.createGain();
  this.ambientGain = this.audioContext.createGain();
  
  // Ambient oscillator
  const oscillator = this.audioContext.createOscillator();
  oscillator.frequency.setValueAtTime(55, this.audioContext.currentTime);
  oscillator.connect(this.ambientGain);
  oscillator.start();
}
```

### Breathing Effect
```javascript
function startBreathingEffect() {
  this.breathingInterval = setInterval(() => {
    const breathingPhase = (Date.now() / 3000) % (Math.PI * 2);
    const breathingOpacity = 0.95 + 0.05 * Math.sin(breathingPhase);
    canvasWrap.style.opacity = breathingOpacity;
    
    // Sync audio with breathing
    this.breathingGain.gain.setValueAtTime(0.1 + 0.05 * Math.sin(breathingPhase), this.audioContext.currentTime);
  }, 50);
}
```
